Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here’s how to get started.

## 🛠 Setup

git clone https://github.com/pierregueroult/next-prisma.git
cd next-prisma
npm install
```

## 🚧 Development

Make your changes in a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature
```

Make sure:
- Code is clean and typed
- You don’t break the build (npm run build)
- The API remains simple and stable

## ✅ Checklist before PR

Only maintainers can publish to npm.
I will handle that part and make sure you are mentioned in the release notes !
